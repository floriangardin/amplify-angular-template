<p class="mt-8">Master Data Management (MDM) is the system that creates a single, trusted version of key entities like customers, products, or suppliers across different business systems.</p>
<p>Matching logic determines how the MDM tool identifies records that represent the same entity (for example, two "Daniel Smith" entries).</p>
<p>When customer data from multiple systems is loaded into MDM, the tool tries to match and merge records that represent the same person or entity.

<p>MDM assigns a match confidence score (0–100%) to each potential duplicate pair based on shared attributes like name, email, phone, and address.</p>
